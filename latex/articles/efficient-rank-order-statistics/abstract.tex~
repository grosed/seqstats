  The computation of both order and rank statistics is often necessary when using non-parametric methods in data analysis. However, it is not uncommon for the computational
  complexity associated with their calculation to be overlooked, both in terms of algorithm design, and data structure choice. Interestingly, this seems to be more
  often the case when there is a requirment that the data is frequently updated, as is the case, for example, when working data streams.

  This note considers the cases of computing the Median Absolute Deviation, (an order statistic), and the Mann-Whitney U, (a rank statistic).
  Importantly, by using an appropriate data structure, it is shown that, for a data store of size $n$, the computational cost of an update is $\mathcal{O}(\log^{2}n)$ for the
  Median Absolute Deviation, and $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ for the Mann-Whitney U statistic .
